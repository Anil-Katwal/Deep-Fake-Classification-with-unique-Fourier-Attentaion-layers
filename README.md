# Deep-Fake-Classification-with-unique-Fourier-Attentaion-layers
This repository is used to classify the deepfake video classification using deep learning techniques with Fourier attention layer. Fourier Attention Layers are a type of neural network layers that uses fourier Transformer techniques into attention mechanism.
